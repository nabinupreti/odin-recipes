    <p>Inspired by a favorite holiday drink, these gingerbread latte cookies are chewy, spicy, and full of molasses and espresso goodness. Give yourself a bit of time to make these as the dough does require several hours of refrigeration before baking.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li><!DOCTYPE html>
        <li>1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon espresso, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsulphured molasses</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>


    <ol>
        <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add in egg, molasses, 2 tablespoons espresso powder, vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice and beat until thoroughly combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in 1 cup flour and baking soda, and mix until just combined. Add in remaining 1 cup flour and mix until just combined. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 48 hours.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>

        <li>Whisk remaining 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 teaspoon instant powder together in a shallow bowl until combined.</li>
        
        <li>Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoons dough, and roll into a ball. Roll dough ball in espresso sugar until thoroughly coated. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing dough balls about 2 inches apart.</li>

        <li>Bake cookies, 1 baking sheet at a time, in the preheated oven, until cookies are crackled on top and edges of the cookies look set, 12 to 15 minutes. Allow cookies to cool for at least 5 minutes on the pan before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
